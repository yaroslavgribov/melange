## Mosaic

A mosaic is a decorative art form created by assembling small pieces of colored materials - typically glass, stone, ceramic tiles, or other hard surfaces - into a pattern or picture. These pieces, called tesserae, are embedded in mortar or another binding material to create a unified surface that can adorn walls, floors, ceilings, or other architectural elements. Mosaics can range from simple geometric patterns to elaborate pictorial scenes, and they have been used across many cultures and time periods, from ancient Roman and Byzantine art to contemporary design.
